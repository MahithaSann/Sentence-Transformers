1. Loss Balancing:
 If one task is more important than the other or if one loss consistently dominates the other, 
 you might need to adjust the relative weighting of each loss.

2. Metric Monitoring:
 For MTL, it's crucial to monitor the performance on both tasks separately. 
 This helps in understanding if the model is favoring one task over the other.

3. Data Handling:
 Ensure that each batch contains a good mix of different classes and sentiments to prevent the model 
 from biasing its learning towards more frequent labels.

4. Regularization and Dropout: 
 As used in the model, dropout helps prevent overfitting to one specific task at the cost of the other. 
 Regularization techniques, such as L2 regularization, can also be applied through the optimizer to help 
 generalize better across tasks.

5. Task-specific Adaptations:
 Depending on the performance, you may find it necessary to adapt the architecture slightly for one of the tasks, 
 perhaps by adding more layers or changing the activation functions in one of the task-specific heads.

This setup encapsulates the typical considerations and structural elements of an MTL training loop in PyTorch, 
balancing learning across tasks while providing flexibility to adjust task priorities as needed.
